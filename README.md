# Dissolve Effect
Created this Dissolve effect I saw in a game using perlin noise, custom shaders and a particle system.

I've been learning GLSL and studying about shaders and particles for past few weeks now, was finally able to use it in this project.

## How it works
- wrote a shader to modify the original material using perlin noise to get the dissolve effect
- made a particle system to emit particles from edges of dissolving mesh
- applied selective unreal bloom post-processing effect
